# Basic-Algorithms
# This project explores fundamental machine learning algorithms with theoretical explanations and practical implementations. The key algorithms covered include:

Linear Regression: A supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm that predicts probabilities for binary outcomes using the logistic function.

ID3 Algorithm (Decision Tree): An information gain-based decision tree learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds trees by selecting attributes that provide the most information gain at each node.

Na√Øve Bayes: A probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence. It is widely used in spam detection and text classification.

This repository serves as a reference for understanding these ML models through step-by-step code and explanations.
